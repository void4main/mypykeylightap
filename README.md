# My Python Key Light AccessPoint

A simple mobile Access Point for my Elgato Key Lights based on an ESP32.

If you have problems to add your Key Lights to your local infrastructure or are in need of a mobile solutions you should have a look of this.

Idea: You create an AP with the ESP32 and add your Key Lights to this AP.
Then you can control the lights everywhere with your mobile phone connected to the AP as well.
